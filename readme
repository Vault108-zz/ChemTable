Hello, 

This project was started in 2013. As an extra credit assigment for my Science class. I have sense decided to work on it in my free time as a public resource that I work on from time to time. Its Totally free to use and to copy, and to modfiy as long as you link it back to me in one of the following ways: 
- Link to my site or the orginial document. 
- Link to me (Sir. Mayo) in the document Saying that i was the Orginial creator. 
- Or just a shout out to me. :)
